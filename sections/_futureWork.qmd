# Rust language - Its future
The learning curve is steep, but there are a lot of resources from which you can learn. Just like Java and C++, Rust use cases and is based on a solid foundation. It doesn’t require you to know about the underlying theory because it uses traits, which enables the programmer to avoid writing low-level code.

Looking forward, Rust will overcome and improve some deficiencies in order to be used more frequently in the development of new projects [@10PredictionsFuture2022].

1. __Rust will become more standardized and grow faster.__ $\\$
The core language is currently being adapted to a wide variety of projects. It’s beginning to stabilize, and the future of Rust as a powerful language is bright.

2. __Rust will replace Java in a few years.__ $\\$
Sun Microsystems developed Java in 1991 and has accumulated many techniques over time. When you compare it with C++ or Rust, it’s already ancient. Due to its age, it’s becoming more vulnerable to attacks and less efficient.

3. __Rust will be used in things like the kernel and data storage.__ $\\$
The core of a car or computer is called the kernel, built on a real-time operating system. If Rust can be adapted to run on real-time operating systems, it will make the kernel much more reliable by eliminating errors that could put people’s lives at risk.

4. __Rust will be used more when making devices more efficient.__ $\\$
If you work in embedded devices development, Rust gives you a lot of possibilities for saving power without losing performance.

5. __Rust will be used in high-risk systems.__ $\\$
High-risk systems like nuclear power plants and space rockets will use it. To create software for high-risk schemes, you should look closely at Rust.

6. __Rust will be used in the creation of libraries.__ $\\$
As an intermediate to help programmers write code quickly, Rust allows a programmer to write code in a short time.

7. __Rust will be used for server-side applications.__
Rust is ideal for server-side development. It’s becoming popular in the server-side development industry.

8. __Rust will be used for mobile devices and embedded devices.__ $\\$
It performs well on low-power systems, enhancing the smartphone and tablet experience.

9. __Rust will become a better alternative to C++.__
All programming languages are going in the same direction. They are heading towards the appearance of one language, but it’s not clear at the moment what that language will be. We may see Rust or something else in a few years.

10. __Rust will enable you to get more out of your program’s CPU.__ $\\$
Java and C++ share the same portability, scalability, and performance. However, when it comes to performance, Rust vastly outperforms them. Why is that? It’s because Rust gives you control over practically everything.

Rust is going to be used for many different kinds of applications. It’s designed to be as flexible as possible, and with that in mind, a programmer should be able to use it for almost any project. Too many programming languages don’t do what they say they will do. Rust is already proving to be the next big thing while being incredibly stable and reliable.
